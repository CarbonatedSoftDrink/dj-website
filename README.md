To deploy the app to our Github Pages branch, you must load the branch you want to deploy and open a terminal inside of the repository. Then, if you have all the dependencies installed, you can type into the terminal the following command:

npm deploy

This command will deploy a distributable version of the app to the gh-pages branch.
